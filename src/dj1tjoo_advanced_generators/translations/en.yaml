    reward_advanced_energy_tunnels:
        title: Energy and Pipe Tunnel
        desc: The <strong>energy tunnel</strong> and <strong>pipe tunnel</strong> have been unlocked - You can now tunnel energy and fluids below belts and buildings with it!
    reward_advanced_energy_fluids:
        title: Pumps and Fluids
        desc: The <strong>pump</strong> and <strong>magma generator</strong> have been unlocked - You can now pump water and generate energy by using magma!
    reward_advanced_energy_steam_turbine:
        title: Steam and Turbine
        desc: "The <strong>steam generator</strong> and <strong>turbine</strong> have been unlocked - You can now generate steam from water and energy! <br /> Steam can be used to create energy in the turbine. The turbine needs to be assembled with different parts. Balance out these parts to generate the optimal energy generator. The turbine also needs fuel. There are 4 tiers of fuel: <br /> - CuRuCuRu has a 1:2 energy ratio <br /> - CgRyCgRy:CyRbCyRb has a 1:3 energy ratio <br /> - SyCcSyCc:ScCyScCy:CwRcCwRc has a 1:4 energy ratio <br /> - CgSyCgSy:SpCySpCy:--RcCwRc:Cy------ has a 1:5 energy ratio"
